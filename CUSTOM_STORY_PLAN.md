Instead of monster battles, answer questions:

- "What month did we meet?"
- "What's our song?"
- **Correct = Fast completion, Wrong = Time penalty**

### **Challenge Type 2: Memory Match**
Use existing monster icons as memory cards:
- Match pairs of "memories"
- Each pair represents a moment (you define)
- Example: Two Atrox icons = "First Kiss"

### **Challenge Type 3: Time Management**
- Choose between fast route (risky) vs safe route (slower)
- Talk to right NPCs vs wrong NPCs
- Collect items efficiently

### **Challenge Type 4: Obstacle Encounters**
Replace monster encounters with:
- "Procrastination" (grass_boss) - Tries to delay you
- "Doubt" (fire_boss) - Quiz about relationship confidence
- "Traffic" (water_boss) - Navigation challenge
