## ✅ **WHAT'S BEEN DONE:**

### **1. Item Collection System** ✅
- Changed from 30 flowers to **3 ITEMS** (Gift, Flowers, Cake)
- UI shows checklist: `[X] Gift`, `[ ] Flowers`, `[ ] Cake`
- Each item collected from specific NPCs

### **2. Harder NPCs** ✅
- **o2 (Shop Owner)**: 2 battles (Jacana Lv18, Pluma Lv20) + 1 quiz → GIFT
- **o3 (Gardener)**: 2 battles (Atrox Lv22, Finsta Lv24) + 1 quiz → FLOWERS
- **o4 (Baker)**: 2 battles (Charmadillo Lv26, Friolera Lv28) + 1 quiz → CAKE
- Time cost: 45 minutes per NPC

### **3. Updated Dialogs** ✅

## 🚧 **STILL NEED TO DO:**

### **Critical:**
1. **Ice Area Blocking** - Add code to prevent entering ice until all 3 items collected
2. **Haider Placement** - Make sure o5 is in the ice area (top-left)
3. **Test Playthrough** - Verify everything works end-to-end

### **The Ice Area Block:**
Need to add code that:
- Detects when player tries to enter ice biome
- Checks if `all(self.collected_items.values())` 
- If FALSE: Block player, show message "The ice area is locked! Collect all 3 items first!"
- If TRUE: Allow entry, set `self.ice_area_unlocked = True`
