## ⚙️ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

### **Pre-Quiz Dialogue:**
```python
# After battle victory, show pre-quiz dialogue first
if has_quiz and not character.character_data['defeated']:
    character.change_facing_direction(self.player.rect.center)
    self.create_dialog(character, dialog_type='pre_quiz')
```

### **Quiz Triggers After Dialogue:**
```python
def end_dialog(self, character, trigger_quiz=False):
    if trigger_quiz and 'question' in character.character_data:
        self.start_quiz(character)
        return
```

### **Item Award on Correct Only:**
```python
if self.correct:
    item_reward = self.question_data.get('item_reward')
    if item_reward:
        self.game.collected_items[item_reward] = True
        self.game.audio['notice'].play()
else:
    # Wrong - reset for retry
    self.character.character_data['defeated'] = False
    penalty = self.question_data.get('wrong_penalty', 20)
    self.game.current_game_time += penalty
```
