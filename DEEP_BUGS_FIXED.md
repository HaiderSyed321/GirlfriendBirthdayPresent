# 🔍 DEEP CODE ANALYSIS - ALL BUGS FIXED

## 🐛 **CRITICAL BUGS FOUND AND FIXED:**

### **BUG #1: Quiz Not Displaying**
**Symptom:** Quiz never shows up, immediately goes to "INCORRECT" result

**Root Cause:**
Player was **NEVER unblocked** after pre-quiz dialog ended, so they couldn't interact with the quiz. The quiz was created but player was blocked.

**Flow Analysis:**
```
1. Battle ends
2. Pre-quiz dialog shows (player still blocked from battle)
3. Dialog ends → start_quiz() called
4. Quiz created BUT player still blocked ❌
5. Player can't press SPACE to answer
6. Timer expires → auto-finishes quiz as incorrect ❌
```

**The Fix:**
```python
def end_dialog(self, character, trigger_quiz=False):
    self.dialog_tree = None
    
    if trigger_quiz and 'question' in character.character_data:
        # CRITICAL: Unblock player so they can interact!
        self.player.unblock()  # ✅ ADDED
        self.start_quiz(character)
        return
```

### **BUG #2: Battle Immediately Ends on Retry**
**Symptom:** After wrong answer, next battle starts but ends instantly

**Root Cause:**
Character monsters are **NEVER RESET** between battles. They stay at 0 health from previous battle!

**Code Analysis:**
```python
# entities.py line 63
self.monsters = {i: Monster(name, lvl) for i, (name, lvl) 
                 in character_data['monsters'].items()}
```
- Monsters created ONCE when Character is initialized
- After first battle: monsters have 0 health
- Retry battle uses SAME Monster objects with 0 health
- Battle system sees defeated monsters → ends immediately ❌

**The Fix:**
```python
def end_dialog(self, character, trigger_quiz=False):
    # ...
    elif not character.character_data['defeated']:
        # CRITICAL: Reset character's monsters to full health
        if character.monsters:
            for monster in character.monsters.values():
                monster.health = monster.get_stat('max_health')  # ✅
                monster.energy = monster.get_stat('max_energy')  # ✅
                monster.initiative = 0  # ✅
                monster.defending = False  # ✅
        
        # Now start battle with full-health monsters
        self.transition_target = Battle(...)
```

### **BUG #3: Player Block/Unblock State Issues**
**Symptom:** Player sometimes stuck, sometimes can move during quiz

**Root Cause:**
Inconsistent player blocking/unblocking across different states.

**The Fix:**
```python
def start_quiz(self, character):
    # Ensure clean state
    self.player.unblock()  # ✅ Clean slate
    
    # Create quiz
    self.quiz = Quiz(...)
    
    # Block during quiz (can't move)
    self.player.block()  # ✅ Prevent movement

def end_quiz(self, character):
    was_correct = self.quiz.correct
    self.quiz = None
    
    # Always unblock after quiz
    self.player.unblock()  # ✅ Can move again
    
    # Show result dialog
    self.create_dialog_for_quiz_result(character, ...)
```
